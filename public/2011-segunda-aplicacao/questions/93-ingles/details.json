  "context": "Last Monday was a really awful day. I got to school late because I had missed the bus. Then I had a Math test and did badly because I hadn’t studied for it. Things went from bad to worse: while I was waiting for the bus home I realised I had lost my money so I had to walk home. I really wanted to go to the cinema with my parents that evening but by the time I got home they had already gone out. I put my dinner in the oven, went to watch TV and fell asleep. When I woke up an hour later, there was a terrible smell and smoke coming up the stairs: I had forgotten to take my dinner out of the oven.\n\n                                                  ACEVEDO, A.; GOWER, M.
